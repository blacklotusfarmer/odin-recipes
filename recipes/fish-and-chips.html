    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large potatoes, peeled and cut into strips</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>

        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1Â½ pounds cod fillets</li>   
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place sliced potatoes in a medium bowl and cover with cold water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper together in a separate medium bowl. Add milk and egg; stir until batter is smooth. Let stand for 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, heat oil in a large pot or electric skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

        <li>
            Drain and pat dry potatoes. Fry in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes; drain on paper towels.
